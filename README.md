# Signal Processing using Python

This project covers several signal processing concepts using Python libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and SciPy. 

1. **Continuous and Discrete Signals**
   - Demonstrates the generation and plotting of continuous and discrete signals, including analog, sampled, and quantized signals.

2. **Unit Impulse Signal**
   - Illustrates the generation and visualization of unit impulse and shifted unit impulse functions.

3. **Sine Wave and Exponential Signal**
   - Shows the creation and plotting of sine waves and exponential signals in both continuous and discrete forms.

4. **Fourier Transforms**
   - Explains the Fourier Transform and its application in sampling sine waves at various frequencies, highlighting aliasing and reconstruction.

5. **Gibbs Phenomena**
   - Demonstrates the Gibbs phenomenon and its effects on Fourier series approximations.

6. **Denoising Data with FFT**
   - Covers the application of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for denoising signals by filtering out noise.

7. **Spectral Derivative**
   - Describes the computation of derivatives using spectral methods (FFT) compared to finite difference methods.

8. **Spectrogram (Gabor Transform)**
   - Shows the creation of spectrograms for analyzing the frequency content of signals over time using the Gabor Transform.

9. **Image Compression with Wavelets**
   - Introduces wavelet transform for image compression, visualizing signal processing with continuous wavelet transform (CWT).

10. **TensorFlow Performance Benchmark**
    - Provides a simple performance benchmark using TensorFlow to measure the speed of signal processing tasks.
